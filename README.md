### My Flask website.

This repo contains the code for my site, www.bendixon.net. 

The goal of this project was to expand my skillset in web development and AWS services. 

The site is hosted on Elastic Beanstalk. Temperature data collected by a RaspberryPi and stored on DynamoDB.  

### Things to do 

- Set up CodeBuild to make deployment easier
- Set up SSL
- Import ML models trained in the RasPi temperature repo
- Try rebuilding the site in a serverless approach, using Lambdas
